Description: Implements Hamilton MG, Kerr RJ. Computation of the inverse additive relationship matrix for autopolyploid and multiple-ploidy populations.  Generates A (parents only), A inverse (and ASReml giv), K (coancestry matrix; parents only), K inverse and inbreeding (F) coefficients for polyploid pedigrees.
    Generates the A inverse of pedigrees in which some individuals have uncertain pedigree. See Henderson CR (1988) Use of an average numerator relationship matrix for multiple-sire joining. J Anim Sci 66:1614-1621. doi: 10.2527/jas1988.6671614x
